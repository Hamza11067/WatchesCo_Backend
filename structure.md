A standard folder structure for a Node, Express, and MongoDB backend project is designed to separate concerns and keep the code organized. This structure makes the project easier to scale and maintain.

## Project Root

At the top level of your project, you'll have some essential files and folders:

  * **`node_modules/`**: This directory is where Node.js stores all the project dependencies installed via npm. You don't create this; it's generated when you run `npm install`.
  * **`package.json`**: This file manages the project's dependencies and scripts. It's the manifest for your project.
  * **`.gitignore`**: This file tells Git which files or folders to ignore when committing to the repository (e.g., `node_modules/`, sensitive configuration files).
  * **`server.js`** or **`app.js`**: This is the entry point of your application. It's where you initialize your Express app, connect to the database, and start the server.

## Core Application Structure

Within the project root, the main folders will house the logic for your application.

### `src/` (or `app/`)

This is the main folder for your application's source code. All the following subdirectories will typically reside inside `src/`.

### `config/`

This folder holds configuration files for your application. This is a good place to put settings that might change depending on the environment (e.g., development, production).

  * **`db.js`**: Contains the logic to connect to your MongoDB database.
  * **`config.js`**: Stores application-wide settings like port numbers, API keys, and environment variables.

### `models/`

This directory contains the Mongoose schemas for your data models. Each file represents a collection in your MongoDB database.

  * **`User.js`**: Defines the schema for a user.
  * **`Product.js`**: Defines the schema for a product.

### `routes/`

This folder is where you define the API endpoints for your application. Each file in this folder should handle a specific set of related routes.

  * **`userRoutes.js`**: Contains all routes related to users (e.g., `/api/users`).
  * **`productRoutes.js`**: Contains routes for products (e.g., `/api/products`).

### `controllers/`

This directory houses the business logic for your routes. Controllers handle incoming requests, interact with models, and send back responses. By separating controllers from routes, you keep your route files clean.

  * **`userController.js`**: Contains functions like `createUser`, `getUserById`, `updateUser`.
  * **`productController.js`**: Manages product-related logic.

### `middleware/`

This folder is for middleware functions that execute before a controller. Common examples include authentication, logging, and error handling.

  * **`authMiddleware.js`**: A function to check if a user is authenticated.
  * **`errorMiddleware.js`**: A custom error-handling function.

### `utils/`

This directory is for utility functions that can be used across different parts of your application.

  * **`jwtUtils.js`**: Functions for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.
  * **`helpers.js`**: General helper functions.
